<h2>Biography</h2>
<br/>
<p>Hi there! I'm Tom, and I'm a Computer Scientist. I'm originally from Leicester, but now I'm a student at the <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk">University of Southampton</a>, reading Computer Science with Mobile and Secure Systems at <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">ECS</a>. I enjoy programming in Python and Java, but I've also dabbled in Perl and C. As you can probably tell from my choice of degree, I'm interested in the security aspect of computers - I'm particularly interested in the field of forensic computing (and especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a>), but for now I'm content to try my hand at a little of everything. After all, you never know what might come in useful.</p>
<p>During the summers of '11 and '12 I interned in ECS's <a href="http://wais.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">Web and Internet Science</a> lab, working on some really interesting projects - head over to my <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> to take a look.</p>
<p>Outside of work I enjoy listening to music, especially classic rock, as well as playing and running classic table-top games. I also play 'cello at a Grade 8 level in the university string orchestra, <a href="http://sustrings.susu.org/">SUStrings</a>.</p>
