<h2>Research</h2>

<div class="row">

		<p>My research is currently looking into how people argue on the world wide web, particularly on different types of social media. There has been a lot of work done in the areas of formal and logical argumentation, but if you've ever seen the comments section of YouTube or a full blown Twitter-storm, then you'll know that people often aren't very formal or logical.</p>
		<p>My aim at the moment is to create a novel means of capturing the way people argue online right now - hopefully this will allow for future work into examining (and even potentially modifying) these modes of behaviour.</p><br/>
