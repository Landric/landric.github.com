		<p>My research is currently looking into how people argue on the world wide web, particularly on different types of social media. There has been a lot of work done in the areas of formal and logical argumentation, but if you've ever seen the comments section of YouTube or a full blown Twitter-storm, then you'll know that people often aren't very formal or logical.</p>
		<p>My aim at the moment is to create a novel means of capturing the way people argue online right now - hopefully this will allow for future work into examining (and even potentially modifying) these modes of behaviour.</p><br/>
        <p>To give a broad overview of this topic area, I wrote a short talk that illustrates some of the background, problems and future work. You can take a look at the <a href="/argumentation-presentation/">presentation slides</a> or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14RLy62byTU">video of me</a> presenting it. The code behind the presentation is also available on <a href="http://github.com/Landric/argumentation-presentation">GitHub</a>.
