<h2>Biography</h2>
<br/>
<p>Hi there! I'm Tom, and I'm a Computer Scientist. I'm a postgraduate student in the <a href="http://wais.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">Web and Internet Science</a> group at the <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk">University of Southampton</a>. If you're interested in what I get up to in the lab, hop over to the <a href="research.html">Research</a> page.</p>

<p>I'm originally from Leicester in the midlands, but I moved down to Southampton for my undergraduate course. During my degree, I did a lot of work on mobile and secure systems, particularly forensics. This culminated with a project in my third year examining the uses of computerised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a> (the art of sending hidden messages). I enjoy programming in Python and Java, but I've also dabbled in Perl, C and some Javascript and PHP.</p>

<p>During the summers of '11 and '12 I worked as an intern with the WAIS group on some really interesting projects, which really sparked my interest in academia and research. These included a new way of generating narratives with ever increasing levels of detail and an innovative way of collecting and distributing academic news feeds - head over to my <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> to take a look.</p>

<p>Outside of work I enjoy listening to music, especially classic rock, as well as playing and running classic table-top games with the <a href="http://www.sotongamesoc.com/">Southampton University Games Society</a>. I also play 'cello in the university string orchestra, <a href="http://sustrings.susu.org/">SUStrings</a>.</p>
